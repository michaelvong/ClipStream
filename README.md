# ClipStream

Description: <br/>
   Created a web application to aggregate Twitch clips from channels that the user follows. 
   Clips are gathered if they are from the past 7 days and if they have 500 or more views. 
   With the clips gathered from the Twitch API, the application displays them to the user
   in descending order by view count. Users can keeep scrolling to view all the clips that were
   gathered until there are no more clips to display. Users can see the broadcaster's name,
   clip title and clip view count for each clip. Clicking on a clip will direct the user to 
   the twitch link of the clip. <br/>
 
To Run: <br/>
'npm start' when you are in the '/client/my-app/' directory to start the client side <br/>
'npm run devStart' starts the server and allows for auto-refresh when saving the file <br/>
